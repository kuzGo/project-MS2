London Libre is a small business based in London. The business owner is an experienced and awarded barman , with years of experience working and travelling around the world on cruise ships,collecting  recipes from various different parts of the globe  . The business is aiming towards hiring a cocktail bar, and/or a bartender for any occasions such as weddings, corporate events etc. The business owner is also attending most of the major music festivals and offering customers an opportunity to taste the best in business cocktails in his pop-up bar. With this idea in mind, inspired with a mixture of colors,liquids, fun and neon lights as a symbol of cocktail bars as well as nights out, London Libre website design came into place. Dominant dark color has a goal to trigger a feeling of the nights out to potential users,also to define simplicity and elegance. Along with bright color combinations throughout the website the aim is to put users into a positive mood and possibly make a decision to hire a bartender. In the meantime when there are no festivals happening, the owner is brushing up his cocktail making skills in one of London's prestigious venues.
